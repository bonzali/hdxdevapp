## FrontEnd Mobile App Challenge
This is a React Native project built with
[`expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/).

## Getting Started
Starting the development server
```bash
expo start
# or
npm start
```
When you run expo start (or npm start), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, 
which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app and serves 
it to the Expo app. 
##Opening the app on your phone/tablet
On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
